            <h2>Daft Punk’s Electroma</h2>

            <p>Electroma opens with the two iconic robots of Daft Punk driving through the desert in their black Ferrari. Eventually they
            arrive in a small town that is completely inhabited by robots. The two drive to a stark and sterile lab where they undergo
            a transformation: their quest, it seems, is to become human. Latex is poured over their helmets and shaped into grotesque
            caricatures of Thomas and Guy-Man’s faces. But when the robots return to town, their new form is rejected and they barely
            evade a menacing pursuit by the other robots. Crestfallen, they tear off their monstrous visages and begin a long trek into
            the desert to meet their fate.</p>

            <p>The film began as an attempt to shoot a video for the title track of Daft Punk's third album, Human After All, but instead
            they decided to write, direct and shoot a feature-length film. To focus on their work behind the camera, Thomas and Guy-Man
            hired actors to portray their robot alter egos. Inspired more by surrealist paintings than film, Electroma is an intensive
            visual experience that encourages audience interaction. There is also no dialogue. Throughout its 74-minute runtime, long
            periods of silence are segmented by a non-Daft Punk soundtrack. The film premiered on May 21, 2006 at the Cannes Film Festival.
            In 2007, it was shown in a limited run of midnight screenings and later released on DVD.</p>
