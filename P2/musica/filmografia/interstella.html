                <h2>Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem</h2>

                <p>This 68-minute animated film, written by Daft Punk and produced by Toei Animation Studios in Japan, is an intergalactic adventure
                set to the music of Discovery. It tells the story of an alien band kidnapped during a concert on their home world by a twisted
                music producer, Earl de Darkwood. They are brought to Earth where they are reinvented as humans and christened the Crescendolls,
                the next pop sensation. Stripped of their free will and forced to perform, the band’s only hope is Shep, a soldier from their
                planet who must restore their identities and stop Earl’s dastardly ambitions, which go far beyond fame.</p>

                <p>Both fans of anime and manga legend Leiji Matsumoto, Thomas and Guy-Man met with him in the summer of 2000 to talk about
                working on a visual accompaniment to their second album. The two, with partner Cedric Hervet, wrote a script and traveled
                between France and Japan almost monthly to work out storyboards with Matsumoto, who supervised the animation. Each song was
                animated, one at a time, over the next couple of years. Daft Punk were still working on Interstella in the weeks leading
                up to its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2003. It was shown at film festivals in several countries and released
                worldwide on DVD later that year.</p>
